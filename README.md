Next, change the paths in main.py on lines 12-22, 140, 141, 269, 270 to the appropriate paths for each file. 
Lastly, you just need to run main.py, and then go into your browser of choice (I use chrome) and go to http:\\127.0.0.1:5004 
Type in "SampleAccount" as the username and "SamplePassword" as the password to gain access to the website.
